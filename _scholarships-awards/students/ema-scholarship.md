### Past Scholar
**Nathaniel Tang, Principal Analyst, Economic Regulation Division** <br/>
_As an individual who is always interested in the economic mechanisms of industrial markets, and curious about policy formation, being a scholar with EMA provided the perfect fit. I have had the chance to work alongside teammates from differing disciplines, providing novel perspectives and allowing me to enlarge my understanding of a broader range of concepts. At EMA, my role involves advancing enhancements to the dynamic energy market and its underlying market structures – that has piqued my intellectual curiosity in finding new ways to tap on new and existing energy sources in a more sustainable and efficient manner. EMA support these interests by providing regular engagements with industry players, overseas study trips as well as developmental courses._

**Ekko Chua, Senior Analyst, Energy Planning & Development Division** <br/>
_Since young, I was intrigued by energy especially how it always seemed to be limitless. Growing up I learnt that energy is a finite resource and it was through Singapore’s endeavours that made energy so readily accessible and available for all Singaporeans. Ever since, that sparked an interest in me to play a part in Singapore’s energy landscape to shape our future energy story. EMA scholarship made it possible by allowing me to advance my study in Master of Engineering (Chemical and Energy Engineering), to be able to contribute my knowledge in the energy space. My role in Strategic Corporate Planning involves developing the longer term strategies of the energy sector and aligning EMA’s priorities towards our longer term objectives. Knowing that I am working in an industry that touches many people is really fulfilling. It helps even more knowing that my role contributes to a cleaner energy landscape to do our part for climate change._
