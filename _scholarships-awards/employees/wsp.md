The SkillsFuture Work-Study Programmes (WSPs) are offered by Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and appointed private training providers. Targeted at fresh graduates from the Polytechnics, Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and mid-career individuals, the wide range of WSPs provides them with a head-start in their careers related to their discipline of study and more opportunities to build on the skills and knowledge they have acquired in school through a work-study arrangement.

Participating employers can recruit local fresh graduates and prepare them to take up suitable job roles. The programme is designed in collaboration with the industry to ensure relevance to employers in the sector. Participants in the programme can look forward to a structured career progression pathway within the organisation.
