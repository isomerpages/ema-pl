### Sector Overview

The Power sector offers meaningful careers that help to keep the lights on and gas flowing for Singapore. The sector anticipates many exciting upcoming developments ranging from the expansion of the Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal, the increasing deployment of solar energy and energy storage, to the need to mitigate cyber-security challenges for power systems. These developments make our daily lives possible today.

A strong-Singapore core that possesses deep and relevant skills is an asset that we must nurture together. Early to mid-career Singaporeans in the Power or related sectors can apply for the SkillsFuture Study Award for Power sector to support them in deepening their power engineering skills.
