The Power sector plays a critical role in sustaining Singapore’s economy. With the dynamic energy landscape (e.g. Singapore’s first Liquefied Natural Gas Terminal, new plantings and innovations in smart grids, gas and energy storage technologies), demand for skilled local workforce is expected to grow further. The forum provides participants with an appreciation of Singapore’s exciting energy landscape, and how the industry is collaborating very closely with EMA to push these developments. The topics discussed would be relevant to the Energy topic within the Geography and Sciences syllabus as well as to Applied Learning Programmes on Environmental Science & Sustainable Living and Environment Education. The talk will also be useful for the development of associated teaching resource materials.
