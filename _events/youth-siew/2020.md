Youth@SIEW is a key outreach platform to engage tertiary students and educators on the latest energy trends and job opportunities to induce interest in the energy sector, held during the annual Singapore International Energy Week. The theme for Youth@SIEW 2020 is "Seizing Opportunities in a New Energy Landscape".

The event allows participants to engage in meaning discussions with industry and government on energy issues and the importance of innovation and co-creation in achieving a more sustainable energy future, as well as gain insights on energy developments and challenges.

Youth@SIEW also features exhibitions that showcase energy-related innovations by students from various institutes of higher learning. This year, the projects are featured along the themes of Decarbonisation and Digitalisation.

## 2020 Youth Energy Showcase

### ITE College East
**EnergICE**   

**Summary of project**  
This project aims to leverage the difference in electricity prices at night and harness this energy to be used in the daytime. EnergICE is a new concept of energy storage, in which thermal energy is “stored” in cool/ frozen fluids that can then be channelled back into the air-conditioning system during the day, when electricity rates are higher

### Ngee Ann Polytechnic
**Ecotile**  
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5_T_N4Vvn8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
This project aims to design a modular solution to harness energy from the Sun that can be fully integrated into today's modern landscape, while complementing existing sustainable systems and infrastructure. The goal is to increase the types of green energy devices available for the world to use, as some green energy devices like wind turbines are not feasible for use in Singapore.

### Republic Polytechnic
**Harnessing Energy from Human Motion using Mechanical Energy Harvester**  

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDYpcLP7Ts4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

**Summary of project**  
This project aims to develop a vibrational energy harvester capable of harnessing energy from motion. The energy generated will be transferred to and stored in an energy storage device (e.g. Li-Ion battery) via a power management circuit. Eventually, the goal is to develop a wearable energy harvester prototype that can charge up portable electronic devices (e.g. mobile phones) through human motion

### Singapore Polytechnic
**Solar Garden Pavilion**  

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jR-AjDwJrbk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

**Summary of project**  
This project aims to design and build a smart, green energy, sustainable, small full-scale prototype solar pavilion space for study or leisure, that can be placed in public parks or gardens. The team has designed a solar powered pavilion prototype which can provide a sheltered sitting space with air cooling, lighting and charging for mobile devices.
