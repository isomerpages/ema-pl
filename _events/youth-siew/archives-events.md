Youth@SIEW is a key outreach platform to engage tertiary students and educators on the latest energy trends and job opportunities, held during the annual Singapore International Energy Week. The theme for Youth@SIEW 2020 was "Seizing Opportunities in a New Energy Landscape".

The event allowed participants to engage in meaningful discussions with industry and government on energy issues and the importance of innovation and co-creation in achieving a more sustainable energy future, as well as gain insights on energy developments and challenges.

Youth@SIEW also featured exhibitions that showcased energy-related innovations by students from various institutes of higher learning. For 2020, the projects were along the themes of Decarbonisation and Digitalisation.

Industry captain Mr Kwong Kok Chan (Deputy General Manager, Maintenance, PacificLight Power Pte Ltd) took the students for a walk down memory lane and shared about how the energy sector had evolved over the years, as well as the exciting yet meaningful careers they could embark on upon their graduation. This nicely complements the launch of our refreshed Skills Framework for Energy and Power (SFwEP), which maps out skillsets for more than 120 job roles, across 11 tracks, in different energy areas including distributed generation management and cyber-security (click <a href="https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/skills-framework/energyandpower" target="_blank">here</a> for more information).
