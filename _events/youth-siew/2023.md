## 2023 Youth Energy Showcase

### ITE College Central
**1. Battery-less Ocean safety beacon**  

**Summary of project**  
The Metal Air Safety Beacon works by generating a small amount of current through the reaction of salt water with metal alloy, which can power up low energy devices like LED, which acts as a light beacon in the event of dark sea accident.
 
The device helps both naval rescuers and divers to locate personnel in the dark sea environment without any battery or power source. From when the device is in a complete dry condition, it takes about 2 to 3 seconds before the light beacon is activated. This allows rescuers to locate the personnel more easily.
 
Other than using this device in the sea, it could also be used during a black out by simply submerging the device into a glass of salt water.
 
Compared to other devices in the market, this device can perform under total submersion in salt water.
 
In terms of duration of light emission, it is highly dependent on the size of the reactor metal alloy – the larger the metal alloy used for the reaction, the longer the light will be emitted. Based on the current size of the metal plate (approx. 60x40x4mm) in the prototype, it can last about 8 to 10 hours in the ocean. When the metal plate is totally dissolved, it can then be replaced with a new plate.

### Ngee Ann Polytechnic

<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZNPJtX0Nxs?si=S_0eNzOkR5SeIKAD" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
This project is a standalone industrial modular fuel cell system which is fuelled by a mixture of methanol in water. It provides DC power-supply to power surveillance security cameras in remote locations where grid power is inaccessible.
 
The remote on-line data access using 4G technology makes the fuel cell condition monitoring and performance assessment available from anywhere at any time. This project solves the problem that users are unable to deploy their portable video surveillance systems and other equipment at locations where there are no power source from the grid.
 
This system’s operating conditions can be remotely monitored using a cloud-based system.

### Republic Polytechnic
**3. Digital Twin Model of RP's Indoor Agricultural Lab (IAL) using BIM/BEM**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wiIMna3CTgI?si=UZg3rTTBsD8Gq5zX" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
The digital twin model of RP Agriculture Lab has been successfully developed using Revit. It has been further enhanced with Blender to create a visually appealing and realistic representation of various components in the lab. Real-time data integration and visualisation were achieved through the Model Viewer and the ThingSpeak channel. This comprehensive workflow and digital twin implementation enables accurate modelling, enhanced visualisation, and data-driven decision-making for effective management of the RP Agriculture Lab.
 
The digital twin model has been used to predict the annual energy consumption of the indoor farm laboratory and water consumption by the plants in a specific grow unit set up. The data has been validated against the similar measured data from the lab with an overall accuracy range of 89% to 94%. Subsequently, the Digital Twin model will be used as an optimisation model to determine energy savings scenarios.  It works by comparing the real-life sensor data used to monitor the climate conditions of the farm with the trend data saved in the historical database. The Digital Twin establishes an energy baseline by analysing historical data and farm operations. It creates a reference point against which energy-saving initiatives can be compared.
 
The outcome of optimising the Digital Twin model is a significant energy reduction of 25% to 35% for the indoor farm. By leveraging the insights, such as energy usage patterns, the efficiency of equipment and systems provided by the digital twin, decision-makers can identify energy-intensive processes and make informed decisions to optimise energy usage. This optimisation process involves adjusting lighting schedules, HVAC systems, and irrigation methods etc.

### Singapore Polytechnic
**4. Study of the Performance of New BIPV Modules in the Tropical Region**  

**Summary of project**  
The new PvFoundry’s BIPV panel combines PV panel with metal roof to maximise the utilisation of metal roof, and helps reduce system costs. The project team set up a testbed in Singapore Polytechnic to test BIPV panels under the site conditions and developed a VBA program for data acquisition and analysis. The program aims to
* acquire the electrical data of PV system from the cloud and weather data from a local datalogger separately;
* clean and sort raw data, merge the data from two different sources;
* conduct data analysis for important operational data of PV system; and
* display the analytic results to the operator for system performance analysis.

### Temasek Polytechnic
**5. Hydrogen fuel cell drone**   

**Summary of project**  
In this project, the team integrates a world-leading compact and light-weight fuel cell technology from Temasek Polytechnic (TP) with an in-house design drone to greatly increase its flight time. Meanwhile, an on-board edge computing system and a dual-lens camera system (vision and thermal), along with the corresponding data analytics algorithms, have been developed and integrated onto the drone. These advancements address the practical challenges faced by the PUB team and significantly enhance their productivity during routine inspection tasks, which are through flying the drone over Singapore's main water supply pipeline. The integrated system is capable of detecting and triggering alarm messages for various critical issues, such as, pipe leaks, water stagnation, defects on the surface of water pipes and illegal dumping.
 
Below are the project development and deployment summaries:
* **Dual-core power design for drone application**: a compact dual power core fuel cell system comprising two 1.8kW air-cooled fuel cell stacks and the corresponding control system
* **Power hybrid technology with low-voltage drop power delivery**: As a power generator operating through chemical reactions on demand, fuel cell stacks inherently lack a good dynamic characteristic. To address this deficiency, the team has successfully developed and validated an efficient power hybrid technology.
* **Optimised airframe and on-board edge computing**: implemented a customised airframe design and integrated an on-board edge computing capability into the drone platform, which include: 1) Large efficiency gains in the airframe design; 2) On-board edge computing, along with custom-developed algorithms, has been implemented for the detection of abnormal situations on PUB water pipelines. This includes identifying issues such as pipe leaks, water stagnation, encroachment, and defects on the water pipes.

### Nanyang Technological University
**6. Fault Detection for Power Cable Protection Systems**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CPtxWjH7prY?si=EDP-PJYNMJnl4k-6" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
A prototype diagnostic tool is made using Arduino and a 3D printed model to be mounted onto the pilot termination block. A continuity tester program installed within the tool using LabVIEW and Arduino is integrated into the diagnostic tool. The program can identify the condition of each wire based on the resistance value and display the results on the User Interface of the LabVIEW program.
 
An average cable diagnosis currently takes about 54 seconds when done manually. On the other hand, the prototype can be mounted onto the termination block and a diagnosis of the cable’s overall health can be completed within 30 seconds or less.
 
The model can also perform functions such as shorting to ground and shorting between pilot cable cores, complementing with the continuity tester to provide condition monitoring for pilot cables in the distribution network. By doing so, the model helps to improve the reliability of the electrical network, maintaining Singapore’s worldclass System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI). The model simplifies the tedious process of checking the health of the cable to a click of a button.
 
Mass production of the product for use by engineers on the ground can help to reduce the amount of manpower and cost required to check the health of the cable. This ultimately lowers the amount of carbon footprint with reduced transportation or unnecessary maintenance/ replacement of the cables in the event where the cable is not healthy.

**7. Flint Paper Battery**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c-JtGA8MmZo?si=x3z34rEwrZICItKk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
As the world moves toward a more sustainable future with the use of more renewables, we face the challenge that the batteries we use currently are not renewable. That is because current battery technologies are highly toxic to the environment and are limited by their design in terms of safety and cost.
 
Flint aims to launch an eco-friendly rechargeable battery made of cellulose paper, zinc, and manganese. This paper battery is eco-friendly as it is  wholly compostable at the end of its life cycle, and is almost half the cost of regular lithium batteries. The paper battery is also flexible as it can be bent into unique shapes, and is much safer than lithium batteries — opening up possibilities to design and manufacture gadgets with it.
 
The team has the working prototypes ready, R&D completed, and extensive progress for commercialisation is underway to increase the efficiency of this battery – to either meet the same standard of lithium batteries or surpass it.

### Singapore Institute of Technology
**8. Real-time Short-term Solar Forecasting for Efficient Load-Demand Management for Microgrids**  

**Summary of project**  
Accurate solar irradiance forecasting is crucial for PV system efficiency due to solar's intermittent nature. The team has developed a low-cost, low-power remote sensor-based data acquisition system for large-scale PV systems. We use Espressif Simple Protocol - Network of Wi-Fi (ESP-NOW) and Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocols for data exchange. ESP-NOW handles short-range communication, while LoRaWAN handles long-range, low-power IoT communication.

Our self-power system monitors up to 12 voltage and temperature channels and 4 current, irradiance, ambient temperature, and humidity strings of PV panels. We employ 2.4GHz ESP-NOW for IoT node communication, with a transceiver node forwarding data via LoRaWAN. The system maintains a sub-3% sensor measurement error and averages an RSSI of -105dBm in non-line-of-sight conditions.
We collect offline and online feature data, with real-time environmental details as inputs for our online prediction model. Sensor data like panel temperature, ambient temperature and humidity, and irradiance feed into machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for single-variable (univariate) and multi-variable (multivariate) analysis. Well-trained model parameters and real-time data are used for online predictions, requiring careful parameter tuning.

Initially, we performed univariate single-step irradiance forecasting using various algorithms. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest (RF) outperformed XGBoost, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and convolutional neural network (CNN). Notably, a lag between prediction and observation persisted in historical data-based forecasting. Subsequently, we introduced multivariate inputs and compared offline and online methods using time-series graphs.

The online approach outperformed offline predictions, correcting errors caused by real-time weather deviations. Our online LSTM-based model achieved the best accuracy with mean absolute error (MAE) of 20.97, root mean square error (RMSE) of 41.49, and R-squared (R2) of 0.95.
We enhanced the online prediction model by incorporating time features to capture temporal patterns and seasonal fluctuations. These improvements facilitate accurate predictions.

In summary, the online method surpasses offline predictions, with a 25% RMSE improvement. These findings will be applied to the operation of the SIT Punggol campus microgrid, contributing to Singapore's transition to a greener, more resilient energy future.


**9. Optimization of Energy Management in Multiple Micro-grids System Based on Predictive Control and Artificial Intelligence**  

**Summary of project**  
The current limitation of a single micro-grid is that it can only generate and distribute power within a localised area when it is operating as an island, independent of the electrical grid. In addition, the intermittent power generated by renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaics (PVs) will cause variations in the output power, voltage, and frequency. Furthermore, in the event one or more energy sources fail or are unavailable, the micro-grid will not be able to meet its own load demand due to limited energy generation capability.
The EDGE funded project “Optimisation of Energy Management in Multiple Micro-grids System Based on Predictive Control and Artificial Intelligence” is a joint project between Power Automation Pte Ltd, Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and National University of Singapore (NUS). The project team has developed an integrated real-time optimised energy management system based on artificial intelligence and predictive control to effectively manage the exchange of energy between multiple micro-grids, which can have very different operating characteristics and dynamics. The predictive control and AI methods would automatically make the optimal decision for the energy storage system (ESS) based on real time information (such as solar PV power, and electricity market) collected from the micro-grids. A communication system based on OPC UA is built for information exchange between the micro-grids and the optimisation software. Based on simulation studies, in certain scenarios, the software can help micro-grids achieve energy savings of about 10%.
 
Multiple micro-grids with different operational specifications and constraints can be interconnected together to overcome the limitations of single micro-grids. Improved security of supply can be achieved by allowing the exchange of power among interconnected micro-grids. However, traditional micro-grid control systems are designed for single micro-grid operations. In addition, the control strategies are usually based on conventional model-based and multi-objective approaches, which will degrade rapidly in performance as systems become more complex with more operational uncertainties.
