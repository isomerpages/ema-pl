Organiser: Energy Market Authority  
Date: 27 October 2023 <br/>
Time: 9:00am - 12:00pm (UTC +8:00) <br/>
Venue: Sands Expo and Convention Centre, MBS Singapore


Held during the annual Singapore International Energy Week, Youth@SIEW is a key outreach platform to engage tertiary students and educators on the latest energy trends and career opportunities in the energy sector. The theme for Youth@SIEW 2023 is “Energy Transition Towards a Net Zero World”. The guest-of-honour is Ms Low Yen Ling, Minister of State, Ministry of Trade and Industry & Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth.

This event provides insights on energy developments and challenges, and provides a platform for participants to be engaged with industry and government on the importance of innovation and co-creation in achieving a more sustainable energy future.

Youth@SIEW also features exhibitions that showcase energy-related innovations by students from various institutes of higher learning. This year, we have also invited industry partners to promote available jobs and internships for students at the networking booths.
