## 2023 Youth Energy Showcase

### ITE College Central
**1. Air-Conditioning Energy Saving Through Reducing Volumetric Cooling Capacity**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ro45ho10zec" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
This project aims to reduce our carbon footprint and improve environmental sustainability by reducing the amount of energy consumed through air-conditioning (A/C).

### ITE College West
**2. Streetlamp Electric Vehicle Charger**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UXBWUTr8m3k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
Presently, the deployment of electric vehicle (EV) chargers in Singapore is constrained by factors such as high costs and land scarcity, which in turn affects the take-up rate of EVs. Our proposed solution reduces the costs and complexity of EV charger installation by tapping on existing streetlamp infrastructure. If replicated on a large scale, this project has the potential to contribute to the Singapore Green Plan 2030.

### Ngee Ann Polytechnic
**3. Standalone Solar Photovoltaic Module Performance Monitoring Test-Bed System**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWjMk9XFM5c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
The aim of this project is to serve as a test-bed for monitoring and testing the performance of different types of solar photovoltaic(PV) modules under all weather conditions. This prototype test-bed setup enables it to function as a standalone and portable system which collects and transmits data for NUS’ SERIS Central Monitoring System (CMS). The rapid development in solar module technologies/manufacturing requires a robust testing system under real-life conditions. The system can monitor real-time data and collect both weather and electrical parameters of the solar PV module for performance benchmarking. Data storage on the cloud server is also available for ease of data analysis.

### Singapore Polytechnic
**4. Hyper Propulsion Power Craft 2.0 (Hybrid Propulsion - Solar Powered Boat)**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xwm0utnes6A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
An improved version of an earlier prototype, this solar-powered craft will be tested in water via a sea trial. The aim is to reduce carbon emissions from large ships by encouraging large vessels to use a cleaner source of energy.

**5. Smart Electric Vehicle Charging and Monitoring System**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/miYjyTHCUZw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
In March 2021, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced a plan to accelerate nationwide deployment of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging points, in support of Singapore’s target to have cleaner-energy vehicles by 2040. A key issue is how to share the usage of charging stations among EV owners fairly, efficiently and effectively. This project aims to address this issue by focusing on the AC charger.

### National University of Singapore
**8. Analysis of Annual Load Loss Due to Voltage Sags in Industrial Distribution Network with Photovoltaics**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YWTuAOMFzk0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
To develop a simulation-based method to calculate the economic impact of voltage sags on industrial distribution systems with Distributed Photovoltaics (PVs), by considering voltage tolerance requirements of industrial loads. To find out how distributed PVs help to reduce the cost of annual load disconnections for industries.

### Singapore Institute of Technology
**9. General-Purpose Cell Balancing for Battery Management System**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BxnM1KZP5aI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
A Battery Management System (BMS) is a critical component of a modern electronic battery system as it extends the battery cells' usable lifespan, thereby reducing environmental waste generated at the battery’s end of life. However, the majority of off-the-shelf BMS products use passive cell-balancing, which wastes energy by dissipating the energy in resistors. This project aims to design and build a more energy-efficient BMS that utilises active cell- balancing applicable to all types of batteries, including Li-ion, lead acid, etc.
