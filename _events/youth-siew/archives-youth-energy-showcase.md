**8. Urban Farming with a Twist**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ImRgkeh0Kc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
This project aims to improve the energy efficiency of solar panels, by reducing the temperature around the solar panel with vapotranspiration from the plants, copper cooling running below the solar panels and evaporative cooling. Reduction in temperature of the solar panels is also expected to increase the lifespan of the panels.

The project also efficiently utilises space and energy resources by having the hydroponics system powered by the solar panel. By combining solar panels and hydroponic crops, this solution can be replicated to tackle land scarcity by maximising Singapore’s existing space.

### Singapore Institute of Technology
**10. Design and Operation Optimisation of a Multi-Energy Micro-Grid**  

**Summary of project**  
The project aims to (i) determine the optimal sizes of components in the Multi-Energy Micro-grid (MEMG) which is also called design optimisation; (ii) decide on the optimal schedule for a MEMG given a fixed optimal sizing; and (iii) implement both optimisation problems in Python using an Optimiser software. The Gurobi Optimiser captures the key features of the optimisation problem in a mathematical optimisation model, and generates an optimal solution based on the defined decision variables. In order to solve the optimisation problem, the user needs to define the problem including objective functions, decision variables and constraints in Python based on the format required by Gurobi. Gurobi, as a solver, will then retrieve the defined optimisation problem and solve it.

### ITE College East
**EnergICE**   

**Summary of project**  
This project aims to leverage the difference in electricity prices at night and harness this energy to be used in the daytime. EnergICE is a new concept of energy storage, in which thermal energy is “stored” in cool/ frozen fluids that can then be channelled back into the air-conditioning system during the day, when electricity rates are higher
