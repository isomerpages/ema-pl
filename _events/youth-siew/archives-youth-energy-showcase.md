### ITE College East
**EnergICE**   

**Summary of project**  
This project aims to leverage the difference in electricity prices at night and harness this energy to be used in the daytime. EnergICE is a new concept of energy storage, in which thermal energy is “stored” in cool/ frozen fluids that can then be channelled back into the air-conditioning system during the day, when electricity rates are higher

### Ngee Ann Polytechnic
**Ecotile**  
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5_T_N4Vvn8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
This project aims to design a modular solution to harness energy from the Sun that can be fully integrated into today's modern landscape, while complementing existing sustainable systems and infrastructure. The goal is to increase the types of green energy devices available for the world to use, as some green energy devices like wind turbines are not feasible for use in Singapore.

### Republic Polytechnic
**Harnessing Energy from Human Motion using Mechanical Energy Harvester**  

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDYpcLP7Ts4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

**Summary of project**  
This project aims to develop a vibrational energy harvester capable of harnessing energy from motion. The energy generated will be transferred to and stored in an energy storage device (e.g. Li-Ion battery) via a power management circuit. Eventually, the goal is to develop a wearable energy harvester prototype that can charge up portable electronic devices (e.g. mobile phones) through human motion

### Singapore Polytechnic
**Solar Garden Pavilion**  

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jR-AjDwJrbk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

**Summary of project**  
This project aims to design and build a smart, green energy, sustainable, small full-scale prototype solar pavilion space for study or leisure, that can be placed in public parks or gardens. The team has designed a solar powered pavilion prototype which can provide a sheltered sitting space with air cooling, lighting and charging for mobile devices.
