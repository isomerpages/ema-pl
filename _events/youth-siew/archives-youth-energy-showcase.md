### ITE College West
**2. Streetlamp Electric Vehicle Charger**  

**Summary of project**  
Presently, the deployment of electric vehicle (EV) chargers in Singapore is constrained by factors such as high costs and land scarcity, which in turn affects the take-up rate of EVs. Our proposed solution reduces the costs and complexity of EV charger installation by tapping on existing streetlamp infrastructure. If replicated on a large scale, this project has the potential to contribute to the Singapore Green Plan 2030.

### Ngee Ann Polytechnic
**3. Standalone Solar Photovoltaic Module Performance Monitoring Test-Bed System**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWjMk9XFM5c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
The aim of this project is to serve as a test-bed for monitoring and testing the performance of different types of solar photovoltaic(PV) modules under all weather conditions. This prototype test-bed setup enables it to function as a standalone and portable system which collects and transmits data for NUS’ SERIS Central Monitoring System (CMS). The rapid development in solar module technologies/manufacturing requires a robust testing system under real-life conditions. The system can monitor real-time data and collect both weather and electrical parameters of the solar PV module for performance benchmarking. Data storage on the cloud server is also available for ease of data analysis.

### Singapore Institute of Technology
**9. General-Purpose Cell Balancing for Battery Management System**  
<iframe width="400" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BxnM1KZP5aI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 

**Summary of project**  
A Battery Management System (BMS) is a critical component of a modern electronic battery system as it extends the battery cells' usable lifespan, thereby reducing environmental waste generated at the battery’s end of life. However, the majority of off-the-shelf BMS products use passive cell-balancing, which wastes energy by dissipating the energy in resistors. This project aims to design and build a more energy-efficient BMS that utilises active cell- balancing applicable to all types of batteries, including Li-ion, lead acid, etc.

### Singapore Institute of Technology
**10. Design and Operation Optimisation of a Multi-Energy Micro-Grid**  

**Summary of project**  
The project aims to (i) determine the optimal sizes of components in the Multi-Energy Micro-grid (MEMG) which is also called design optimisation; (ii) decide on the optimal schedule for a MEMG given a fixed optimal sizing; and (iii) implement both optimisation problems in Python using an Optimiser software. The Gurobi Optimiser captures the key features of the optimisation problem in a mathematical optimisation model, and generates an optimal solution based on the defined decision variables. In order to solve the optimisation problem, the user needs to define the problem including objective functions, decision variables and constraints in Python based on the format required by Gurobi. Gurobi, as a solver, will then retrieve the defined optimisation problem and solve it.
