**There are 3 phases that you need to take note of:**  

**Phase 1 – Virtual Mass Briefing:**  

1. Register your interest for the virtual mass briefing to interact with EMA and industry representatives by 2 June 2022, 12:00pm.

2. The company-specific problem statements tied to the challenge are:

a. Keppel Infrastructure: “With increasing energy demand, Keppel is seeking an integrated solution to reduce energy consumption of a typical building in Singapore through digital technologies such as Internet of Things/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning. The proposed solution should consider the environmental impact, system stability and cost-effectiveness.”

b. Schneider Electric: “With increasing electric vehicle (EV) adoption, Schneider is seeking proposals to reduce carbon emissions and maintain grid reliability. The proposed solution should be cost-effective, suitable for deployment with minimal disruption to existing infrastructure, and increase the use of clean energy for EV charging.”

c. Sembcorp Industries: “Singapore aims to have at least 2 gigawatt-peak of solar deployed by 2030. With more solar in our energy mix, Sembcorp is seeking ways to manage intermittency. The proposed solution may include new technologies to manage the amount of energy flowing into the grid or by creating a suitable environment to maximise the deployment of solar panels. It should be cost-effective, minimise its impact on the grid, be easy to deploy and maintain.”

**Phase 2 – Submission:**  

1. Submit a PowerPoint deck (maximum of 7 slides in .pdf) to showcase the proposed solution(s) to address the selected company-specific problem statement. 

2. Submission period opens from 4 to 30 June 2022, 5:00pm.

**Phase 3 – Semi-Finals and Grand Final:**  

1. Semi-Finalists will present their proposals on 2 September 2022.

2. Finalists will be mentored by the industry representatives to refine their ideas, and pitch to the judging panel and live audience at Youth@SIEW on 28 October 2022.
