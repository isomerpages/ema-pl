    CALLING ALL SECONDARY SCHOOL AND JUNIOR COLLEGE STUDENTS!
    <br/><br/>
    Your Challenge Statement:<br/>
    How would your carbon-free school or neighbourhood in Singapore look like in 2050?
</p>

 
The **Singapore Energy Grand Challenge (Youth)** invites all secondary school and junior college students to put your imagination and creativity to the test through designing Singapore's energy future. Using Microsoft's Minecraft: Education Edition (M:EE), bring to life your vision of a carbon-free Singapore in 2050 and beyond!

Form a team of two to four with your schoolmates to participate in the Junior (lower secondary students) or Senior (upper secondary and junior college students) category and submit a three-minute video that showcases your idea of a carbon-free Singapore using M:EE.

Top 3 teams in the Junior and Senior categories will win cash prizes of up to $10,000 in their respective category.
