#Power Sector Overview

Every day, many activities happen within the Power sector to ensure a stable supply of electricity. This includes securing fuel supply, generating power as well as transmitting, distributing and selling electricity.  The Power sector value chain provides an overview of these various critical functions within the sector. 

Singaporeâ€™s electricity is generated primarily using natural gas. Power generation companies in Singapore have shifted from oil-fired steam plants to more advanced and environment-friendly gas-fired Combined Cycle Plants (CCP) over the years.

The electricity generated at the plants is transmitted and distributed to the industrial and domestic consumers by the power grid, which is owned and operated by Singapore Power.
