Located on Jurong Island, Keppel Merlimau Cogen (KMC) is a 1,300 MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power plant under Keppel Infrastructure Holdings Pte Ltd’s Power & Renewable business. Completed in 2007, KMC also expanded its capacity in 2013 and has provided efficient and reliable electricity to customers in Singapore.

Led by an experienced operations and maintenance (O&M) team, KMC ensures the highest operating standards by carrying out a balance of planned and preventive maintenance strategies. KMC is capable of providing black start services as well as operating on diesel, strengthening its commitment of providing the grid with reliable and secure energy supply with minimal disruption.

KMC has been consistently operating with high efficiency. Over the years, continuous innovation and technology upgrades have also been implemented, resulting in a steady decrease in the plant’s CO2 emissions. This reflects Keppel’s commitment to reducing the carbon footprint of its power plant operations.
