Singapore LNG Corporation (SLNG) was incorporated in June 2009 to develop, build, own and operate Singapore’s very first open-access, multi-user Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal, a key national infrastructure that supports Singapore’s diversification strategy to enhance energy security and future economic development in the energy sector.

The terminal began commercial operations in May 2013. Its core businesses include LNG terminalling, storage, regasification and send-out, vessel cool-down and storage and reload services. SLNG aims to develop the terminal into a gateway for LNG in Asia and to establish Singapore as the LNG Hub for the region.
