Leveraging EMAâ€™s experience within the energy sector, our mandate was expanded to develop power engineering capabilities for the Public Service. We work closely with the Public Service Division, Science & Technology Policy and Plans Office and relevant agencies to implement various initiatives to enhance awareness of power engineering job roles in the Public Service and ensure that the current workforce is trained to handle existing and emerging technologies in their respective areas.
