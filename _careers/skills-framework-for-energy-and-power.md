### The Electricity Sector  
Singapore’s electricity grid is one of the most reliable in the world, logging an interruption time of less than one minute on average per customer annually. Singapore’s infrastructure is heavily dependent on electricity, so maintaining a secure and affordable energy supply is essential.

Our electricity market is open and competitive. As the regulator, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) issues licenses to key players such as generation companies, retailers and wholesalers. We promote effective competition in the energy market, ensure reliable energy supply and develop a dynamic energy sector for Singapore. Regulatory measures are also in place to strengthen the overall resilience of the power sector and enhance Singapore’s energy security.

### The Gas Sector  
The gas industry is of vital importance, not only to our nation’s own generation of power but as a driver of economic growth. Similar to the electricity market, the gas sector is structured to encourage competition. To further enhance our energy security, one of the major developments in recent years was the commencement of operations of our Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal. The LNG terminal allows Singapore to source for gas globally to complement piped natural gas that we receive from Indonesia and Malaysia. Beyond this core operation, the terminal enhances Singapore’s position as a centre for LNG trading in Asia, and also has the potential to offer ancillary services like LNG storage.
