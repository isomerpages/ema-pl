The Energy Ambassadors Programme (EAP) was launched by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) in 2018 and aims to identify students with a keen interest in energy-related issues, as well as sustain their enthusiasm by involving them in sector-wide outreach events. This is part of EMAâ€™s effort to create and nurture a group of like-minded individuals who are enthusiastic and are interested in contributing to the energy sector.
