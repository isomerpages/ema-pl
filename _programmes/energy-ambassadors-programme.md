The Energy Ambassadors Programme (EAP), launched by the Energy Market Authority (EMA), aims to identify students with a keen interest in energy-related issues, and to sustain their enthusiasm by involving them in sector-wide outreach events. This is part of EMAâ€™s effort to create and nurture a group of like-minded individuals who possess strong enthusiasm and interest to contribute to the Energy sector.
