Get real-world insights into the workings of the Power sector with our experiential learning journeys, and experience first-hand how we secure a reliable energy supply to power our little red dot.

### Powering Lives Trails
The Powering Lives Trails (PLTs) are structured, experiential learning journeys designed for students, teaching staff as well as education and career guidance officers from the institutions of higher learning, including ITE, polytechnics and universities. The programme takes participants out of the classroom and into the field, and aims to:

1.    Cultivate early interest among youths about exciting developments and opportunities within the Power sector;

2.    Create an understanding of the application of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) concepts to solve real-world operational challenges; and

3.    Nurture greater awareness about a career in the Power sector.

The PLTs encompass visits to five locations in the Power sector. These are the Power System Control Centre, the Sembcorp Cogen @ Banyan Plant, the Singapore Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal, the Pulau Ubin Micro-grid Test-bed and the Singapore District Cooling Plant. In addition, there is an introductory presentation to the Power sector and the site/company, an interactive learning activity and a networking/Q&A session.

|---|---|
|**"Gas it Up"**| **@ the Singapore LNG Terminal:** Marvel at Singapore’s only LNG Terminal on Jurong Island, where gas to power Singapore is imported. This critical infrastructure enhances Singapore’s energy security by enabling us to source for gas globally.|
|**"Powering Singapore"**| **@ the Sembcorp Cogen @ Banyan Plant:** Discover the Sembcorp Cogen @ Banyan Plant on Jurong Island, to understand how electricity and steam are produced using gas.|
|**"Behind the Scenes"**| **@ the Power System Control Centre:** Learn about the challenges of managing the nerve centre of Singapore’s power system at EMA’s Power System Control Centre.|
|**"Clean and Green"**| **@ the Pulau Ubin Micro-grid Test-bed:** Explore the Pulau Ubin Micro-grid Test-bed  on Pulau Ubin, for a preview of how solar-storage-smart grid technologies are transforming the grid and how the lives of end-users, who previously depended on noisy diesel generators, are being changed.|
|**"Keeping it Cool"**| **@ the Singapore District Cooling Plant:** Enter the world’s largest underground district cooling system with a visit to the Singapore District Cooling Plant at Marina Bay, which is keeping buildings cool at the Marina Bay business district.  |
