Besides a full-term scholarship, the EIS also offers a mid-term scholarship to those who have already commenced their studies. The bond period will be commensurate with the total scholarship value.

You may submit your application online via the Powering Lives portal during the application cycle which starts in December and closes in March. This application period is applicable whether you are applying for the Full-term or Mid-term scholarship.
