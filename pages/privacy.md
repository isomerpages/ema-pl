### **Privacy Statement**  

1.     This is a Government Agency digital service.

2.     If you are only browsing this website, we do not capture data that allows us to identify you individually.

3.     We may use "cookies", where a small data file is sent to your browser to store and track information about you when you enter our digital service. The cookie is used to track information such as the number of users and their frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred digital services. While this cookie can tell us when you enter our digital services and which pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the digital service.

4.     If you choose to make an application or send us an email for which you provide us with personally identifiable data, we may share necessary data with Government agencies and the relevant non-government entities authorised to carry our specific services relating to your application or email, so as to serve you in the most efficient and effective way, unless such sharing is prohibited by law.

5.     For your convenience, we may also display to you data you had previously supplied us. This will speed up the transaction and save you the trouble of repeating previous submissions. Should the data be out-of-date, please supply us the latest data. We will retain your personal data only as necessary for the effective delivery of public services to you.

6.     To safeguard your personal data, all electronic storage and transmission of personal data is secured with appropriate security technologies.
